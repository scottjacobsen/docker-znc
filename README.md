# A minimal Docker + ZNC + Bitlbee image

Docker-vnc is a simple [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image with
[ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) and
[BitlBee](https://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html) installed and
ready to go.

ZNC's webadmin is ready to go. Just point your browser at
https://ip.of.docker.container/ and login with user `znc` and password
`mL3dBIqNm`. Obviosly the first thing you should do before exposing
the container to the internet is change the password for the `znc`
user.
